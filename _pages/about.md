I'm a research manager at Apple, where I work on the 3D Vision Team. My team and I work on technology that powers features such as Visual Localization for <a href='https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-maps-introduces-new-ways-to-explore-major-cities-in-3d/'>Maps</a> and <a href='https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/06/26/apples-arkit-4-anchors-3d-reality-into-real-world-maps-locations'>Augmented Reality</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF37ZQ_ItNY'>detailed 3D city maps</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Look_Around'>Look Around</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Maps#Flyover_and_3D_maps'>3D Flyover</a>. We tackle a lot of fun (and challenging) problems in large scale 3D mapping, geometry and positioning using a mix of classical geometry and machine learning. If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to <a href="mailto:rraguram@apple.com">get in touch</a>!

I ~~recently~~ a while ago received a PhD from the <a href='https://cs.unc.edu'>Department of Computer Science at UNC Chapel Hill</a>. I worked in the 3D Computer Vision group, advised by <a href='https://cs.unc.edu/person/jan-michael-frahm/'>Jan-Michael Frahm</a> and <a href='https://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/'>Marc Pollefeys</a>. During my PhD, I focused on applications that involved 3D modeling and understanding of real-world scenes, objects and events. 

Prior to UNC, I obtained a Masters degree in <a href='https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu'>Electrial and Computer Engineering</a> from the University of Arizona, where I was a member of the <a href='http://www-spacl.ece.arizona.edu'>Signal Processing and Coding Lab</a>.
