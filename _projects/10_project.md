The JPEG2000 image compression standard is designed to compress both bilevel and continuous tone image data using a single unified framework; however, there exist significant limitations with respect to its use in the lossless compression of bilevel imagery. In particular, there is substantial degradation in image quality at low resolutions, which severely limits the resolution scalable features of the JPEG2000 code-stream. We examine these effects and present two efficient methods to improve resolution scalability for bilevel imagery in JPEG2000. By analyzing the sequence of rounding operations performed in the JPEG2000 lossless compression pathway, we introduce a very simple pixel flipping scheme that improves image quality for commonly occurring types of bilevel imagery. Additionally, we develop a more general strategy based on the JPIP protocol, which enables efficient interactive access of compressed bilevel imagery.
