At UNC, the 3D vision group has developed a real-time system, called UrbanScape, for performing large-scale 3D reconstruction from video. The system achieves high computational performance through algorithmic optimizations, coupled with parallelization and execution on commodity graphics hardware. My contributions to this system include vision-based pose estimation, self-calibration and real-time robust estimation.
