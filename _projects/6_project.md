Recent years have seen an explosion in consumer digital photography and a phenomenal growth of community photo-sharing websites. At UNC, we have developed systems for modeling and visualizing landmarks based on large-scale, heavily contaminated image collections gathered from the Internet. Our approach to this problem encompasses image clustering, robust geometric verification, structure from motion and stereo to achieve high computational performance. Our <a href="assets/pdf/ijcv2011.pdf">original</a> system was capable of handling datasets containing tens of thousands of images, and we have more <a href="assets/pdf/ECCV2010.pdf">recently</a> extended this to be able to process <i>millions</i> of images in a day, on a single PC.
