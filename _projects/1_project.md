<b>RECON: Scale Adaptive Robust Estimation via Residual Consensus</b>
Rahul Raguram and Jan-Michael Frahm
<i>International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011 (Oral Presentation).</i>

In this work, we present a threshold-free robust estimation framework capable of efficiently fitting models to contaminated data. While RANSAC and its many variants have emerged as popular tools for robust estimation, their performance is largely dependent on the availability of a reasonable prior estimate of the inlier threshold. This work builds on the simple observation that models generated from uncontaminated minimal subsets are somehow "consistent" in terms of the behavior of their residuals, while contaminated models exhibit uncorrelated behavior. By leveraging this observation, we then develop a very simple, yet effective algorithm that does not require apriori knowledge of either the scale of the noise, or the fraction of uncontaminated points.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
